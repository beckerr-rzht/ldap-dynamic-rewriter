Virtual LDAP is set of perl scripts which allows you to augment data in your
existing LDAP server (which you don't want to modify) using ldap-rewrite.pl
(supporting rewrite of bind request, search requests and responses).

Alternative usage is to expose SQL database (currently Koha database with users)
to some other system as LDAP server. This supports arbitrary number of objectClass
objects (one per SQL file) and allows export of groups from RDBMS to LDAP groups.


Install with:

  cd /srv
  svn co svn://svn.rot13.org/virtual-ldap/

  cd virtual-ldap
  ./bin/install-debian.sh


If you need to augment or mungle LDAP from upstream server start:

  ./bin/ldap-rewrite.pl

You might want to edit configuration at top of script itself, especially
overlay_prefix if you want your YAML data to be without it.

To augment data with your own, you should create files

  yaml/uid=login,dc=example,dc=com

If you have test user in your LDAP edit configuration file and run tests:

  cp t/config.pl.template t/config.pl
  vi t/config.pl
  ./t/ldap-rewrite.t


If you want to expose MySQL Koha database as LDAP server start:

  ./bin/ldap-koha.pl

Further notes and recommandation

this ldap rewriter does not currently implement SSL. it is highly recommanded to bind it to a local port only and run an openssl instance in front of it that does implement SSL
a sample config is provided in slapd.conf.sample
